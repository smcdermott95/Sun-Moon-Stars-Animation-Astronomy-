# Sun-Moon-Stars-Animation-Astronomy-
A javascript web tool that plays animations of the sky(sun,moon,stars) at a given location and date. Obviously a work in progress. Main file is index.html. See the link for a demonstration of the web app. Note: may be slow for mobile users

I know the script can be quite a mess to look at. I will be working on cleaning it up and adding comments.

TODO(somehwat in order of importance)<br>
  -Add present location drop-down selection for major citys around the world. Choosing a location will update the lat,lon,timezone,etc<br>
  -implement moon phases<br>
  -make the canvas clickable, clicking on a point in the sky shows altitude and azimuth for that point
  -fix the text colors for degree labels<br>
  -automatically set lower playback framerate for mobile users. current playback is choppy due to CPU intensiveness.<br>
  -add an option to select how many stars to generate<br>
  -more commenting and cleanup<br>
  -improve UI<br>
  -improve efficiency<br>
